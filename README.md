# Machine-Learning
First Machine Learning model. Helped from a book but fully created on my own.

I purchased a book called "Neural Networks from Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela
using this I was given a real good understanding of how Neural Networks actually worked behind the scenes. I came to realize the tutorials I watched using tensorflow and all the math they were doing behind the scenes. 

I used the book as a guide to get myself going but after a couple chapters in the book I wanted to make this my own and rarely went back to the book. I knew the algorithms to get the math done and implemented those, I also was able to create my Rectified Linear Activation Function as well as my entire Loss class on my own which I was rather happy with doing. I really think I have a nice understanding of how these complex things work now and maybe for my next project I can use tensorflow and or some other machine learning frame and have a better understanding of what's going on as opposed to when I was just watching tutorials lost after the first minute.



Onto what this actually does.
This Neural Network is supposed to be supervised in learning but could easily be unsupervised if you wanted. I am using this for a project at work in which I take Car Parts loaded onto a paint line and then predict how many good painted parts will be pulled off the line using this Model to also read a live updated schedule. It is supposed to search the schedule when ran and find the "part number" and then read the entire excel spreadsheet row to find out how many parts the schedule calls for and then predict how many good parts we will pull off the paint line. 

as of 12/24/2020 I am st ruggling to find a good decent way to split my training data and have the model learn from the data I have in my spreadsheets.
